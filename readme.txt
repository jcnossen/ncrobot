NCRobot
Robot control + simulation using natural algorithms

Building from source:
- open code/vstudio9/ncrobot.sln
- build the release mode of the ncrobot project (Debug is too slow).
  (this will build bin/ncrobot.exe)
- run bin/ncrobot.exe

Press 'run optimization' to start the optimization process, when it's finished or interrupted, 
the best found control parameters will be used to animate the visible robot.
